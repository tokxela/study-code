# Lab 6: Sensor Fusion

## Introduction
In this lab exercise, you will process time-discrete sensor measurements and detect object occurrences based on sensor-specific thresholds.  
You will use **structs**, **typedef**, and file input/output in C.  

The goal is to:

- read measurement data from files
- model the data using structured types
- determine when objects are detected based on thresholds
- identify overlapping detections from multiple sensors
- output detection intervals in a clear textual format

No plotting is required; the focus is on **data processing and analysis**.

## Requirements

### Data Structures

1. Define a structure `SensorData` with:
   - `time` : double, the time of the sample in seconds (step size 0.02 s)
   - `probability` : double, the measured signal (between 0 and 1)

2. Define a structure `Sensor` with:
   - `id` : int, sensor ID
   - `threshold` : double, detection threshold
   - `data` : array of `SensorData` containing all samples
   - `binary` : array of int, stores detection (1 if signal > threshold, 0 otherwise)

---

### Input Files

Two measurement files are provided:

- `sensor1.txt` : Sensor 1 measurements, threshold 0.8  
- `sensor2.txt` : Sensor 2 measurements, threshold 0.7  

Each file contains two columns:


- Time in seconds (0 to 60 s, step 0.02 s)  
- Signal probability (0 to 1)  

---

### Program Tasks

Implement the following in `main`:

1. Read the two measurement files into `Sensor` structs.
2. For each sensor, generate a **binary detection signal** based on its threshold:
   - 1 if `probability > threshold`  
   - 0 otherwise
3. Determine **start and end times** for each detection interval per sensor.
4. Determine **overlapping intervals** where both sensors detect the object simultaneously.
5. Output all intervals in a clear textual format:
   - Sensor 1 detections
   - Sensor 2 detections
   - Overlapping detections (fusion)

## Example

--- Object Detection Results ---

Sensor 1 detections:
Start: 10.00 s End: 20.00 s
Start: 30.00 s End: 40.00 s
Start: 45.00 s End: 55.00 s

Sensor 2 detections:
Start: 15.00 s End: 25.00 s
Start: 30.00 s End: 40.00 s
Start: 50.00 s End: 60.00 s

Fused signal (both sensors):
Start: 30.00 s End: 40.00 s

## Hints

- Keep track of active intervals using a state variable
- Start a detection interval when `signal[i]` changes from 0 → 1  
- End the interval when it changes from 1 → 0
- Use **arrays of fixed size** (3000 samples)
- No dynamic memory allocation or user-defined functions are required
